		<h3 class="things">You should shave the day of or the day before your spray tanning appointment.  You should also exfoliate your skin the day before your spray tanning appointment. This is to remove any of the dead skin cells on the surface or epidermis layer of your skin. Removing these dead skin cells will help you have a natural even looking even tan and maintain the spray tan for a longer length of time. You can do this the day of your appointment as well, but we recommend that you exfoliate the day before for better results. You can use a simple loofah/exfoliator to do this but we recommend using Infinity Sun's non-abrasive body polisher for best results that can be purchased and used prior to future spray tans.  It is imperative that you refrain from using make-up, lotions, perfumes and deodorants prior to your spray tanning appointment or remove them before your appointment as these act as barriers to the tanning solution and have been known to cause white spots.Please wear loose, dark clothing and open toed sandals to your appointment, as the initial bronzer tends to rub off on light colored clothing.  Any bronzer that rubs off on your clothing will come out in the wash with spray & wash on the cold cycle.
			Spray Tanning can be done in the nude if you prefer to have no tan lines.  Disposable g-string underwear and bandeau bras are also provided for your comfort.  Brazilian Mist will arrive at your scheduled appointment time to set up our equipment.  It is ideal to spray tan you in your bathroom.  We also travel with a portable backdrop which can be set up anywhere in your home.  We also ask that you do not bathe, shower, swim or get wet for at least 8-12 hours after your spray tanning appointment as this will cause the spray tanning solution to wash off leaving you with streaks and an uneven spray tan.</h3>
